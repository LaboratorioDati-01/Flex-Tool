# Flex-Tool
Energy Management Simulator Description This project is an energy management simulator developed in Python, using Streamlit to create an interactive user interface. The simulator allows users to model and analyze various aspects of energy management, including total energy demand, wind and thermal power generation, and energy import. Users can manipulate various parameters such as flexibility factor, flexibility range, and slope to observe how these affect the final price of energy flexibility.

Customizable Input Features: Users can enter specific values for various parameters such as total energy demand, wind and thermal production, and energy prices. Dynamic Calculation: The simulator dynamically calculates the price of energy flexibility based on the inputs provided. Visualization of Results: Calculation results are clearly displayed, enabling users to understand the impact of their choices. Intuitive User Interface: Thanks to Streamlit, the application has a clean and easy-to-use user interface.
